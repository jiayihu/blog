# blog.jiayihu.net

This is the repository of my personal blog [blog.jiayihu.net](http://blog.jiayihu.net). The articles are written in Markdown and the sources can be found in [src/articles](src/articles). Pull Requests are welcome 👨🏻‍💻

## Development

You can develop locally the blog cloning the repository and running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The blog is statically generated by [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io) and a set of custom Gulp tasks. The runtime blog is built with [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io).

Ping me if are trying to fix/improve something and you need more information about the build system.
