Hi, I'm **Jiayi Hu** and I write chronicle posts about my journey as web developer.

I'm currently working as Lead Front-end Developer and Trainer in React technologies, with a strong expertise notably in web architectures, state management and real-time async workflows.
I have accumulated experience as a freelance consultant over the course of several years, addressing a wide spectrum of application challenges, ranging from small startups to globally distributed applications.

On my day-to-day activities I'm currently using `React`, `TypeScript`, `Redux` (with `Redux-saga`), `Fabric.js`, `WebRTC` and `WebSockets` to built collaborative canvas Ã  la Miro.

I'm an active member of the Italian developer communities and I enjoy speaking at public tech events, such as ReactJS Day and Codemotion. I love sharing my insights with peers, team members, and a broader audience., whether as a senior member in the team, teacher, conference speaker or blog writer :).
