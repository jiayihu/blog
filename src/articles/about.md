Hi, I'm **Jiayi Hu** and I write **chronicles** posts about my journey as a young 21 y/o web developer.

I'm currently working remotely as Front-end Developer, Trainer and Consultant leveraging ReactJS & Redux by Facebook and Angular by Google. 

I'm also an active member of the Italian communities *“React Italia”, "Angular Italia" and “Frontenders Verona”* and I enjoy speaking at public tech events.

I love digging into abstract concepts, algorithms, data structures and wondering about architectures. I find myself excited by performant clean code and I'm a strong open-source advocate as well as a contributor.

Also a fan of vanilla Javascript/CSS but I hate vanilla yogurt.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels, dystopian books, watching dramatic films and experimenting in the kitchen.  
I'm definitely better at coding than cooking though.
