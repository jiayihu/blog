Hi, I'm **Jiayi Hu** and I write chronicles posts about my journey as a young web developer.

I'm currently working remotely as Front-end Developer, Trainer and Consultant leveraging ReactJS & Redux by Facebook and Angular by Google. 

I'm also active member of the Italian communities *“React Italia”, "Angular Italia" and “Frontenders Verona”* and I enjoy speaking at public tech events.

I love digging into abstract concepts, algorithms, data structures and wondering about architectures. I find myself excited by performant clean code and I'm a strong open-source advocate as well as contributor.
Also fan of pure Javascript or CSS.

In my spare time I enjoy reading novels and dystopian books or watching dramatic films. Sometimes I also do experiments with cooking but I would not recommend anyone hiring me as chef.
